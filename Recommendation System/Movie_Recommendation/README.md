# 🎬 GenAI Movie Recommendation System

An intelligent movie recommendation app built using **Streamlit**, **HuggingFace embeddings**, **LangChain**, and **Pinecone vector database**. It allows users to select or click a movie and view smart recommendations, complete with movie posters, details, and similar suggestions — all powered by semantic search using vector embeddings.
